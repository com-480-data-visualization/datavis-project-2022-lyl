**10% of the final grade**

### Dataset

The dataset is eSports earnings which is extracted from the kaggle. It provides information on the earnings of eSports players and teams. 

Link: kaggle.com/code/derisnoor/esports-earnings-eda/data

The dataset includes about 2k entries, corresponding to the detailed earnings of eSports players and teams from different countries and regions in 10 games such as Dota2, Fortnite, League of Legends, and so on.

The dataset is clean, we did not observe out-of-range numerical values or digital gibberish in-text attributes. It is ready for data exploration and visualization.


### Problematic

#### Overview 
The topic of our visualization project is to explore the earnings of eSports players and teams. The current scenes have been designed as follows:

1. The audience will be welcomed by a standard title sequence and a nice eSports picture.
2. The second scene showcases the 5 most popular of the 10 games. Clicking on a node triggers the game's theme song, and a brief intro to the game will be given. 
3. In the next scene, there is a heat map of the world that visualizes the average salary of esports players from different continents and countries. 
4. The fourth scene will present the player and the team with the highest earnings in different countries or continents by clicking different regions of the world heat map.

#### Motivation: 
Over the past few years, the eSports industry has been growing, the number of viewers watching these games has increased every year, eSports professional players and video game streaer have become a promising career.

However, people usually do not have an intuitive understanding of the income of e-sports practitioners. We hope to find out what the most popular games are currently through some data exploration and analysis, and display the income of players and teams interactively. We hope that our visualization could help the new gamers or pro gamers to decide which game to learn first or learn next based on popularity and which region is more promising based on the average salary.

#### Target audiences 
* Teenagers who have talents in esports and want to be a professional player or vedio game streamer in the future. They need to search for the income of the top players in the field for the decision-making of their future career plan. For example, they want to know which gaming will let them earn more salary in the same genre.

* Investigators and advertising sponsor who want to promote their product in the tournament or the live streaming like Twitch. The salary of the practitioners the amount of the sponsorship will give them a general information about the popularity of the different games and the budget they need.

> - Why is your approach original?

Most of the Exploratory Data Analysis of the above related works use static visualization and only present statistics values. We want to perform the visualization more interactive and more interesting. Besides the necessary values to show, we would like to use more logos, music and convert the tables to interactive UI blocks. Through our informative design and considerate introduction, the audience can acknowledge the general information of the industry quickly and precisely even if they do not know about the field before.

1.  eSports: Should You Start a Startup? (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jack.daoud/viz/eSportsReport/Story)
* This is the project created by the publisher of the dataset. Combined with other datasets, he presents several aspects of the esports industry vivid and informatively.

2. [Esports Viewership Stats for 2018](https://escharts.com/2018) 
* Esports Charts is a unique analytical agency collecting all information about esports, streaming and providing actual fact data. In this web page, they visualized the viewership statistics for 2018. They showed lots of statistics while most of them are bar charts and non-interactive. However, we like the background layout and the way they use dynamic visualization of static bar values.
